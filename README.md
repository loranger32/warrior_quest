# Warrior's quest

This is an exercise text game about a warrior tasked to save a realm, fight a
dragon, get a treasure back and rescue a princess.

It's still in development.

'synopsis.md' gives a description of the game.

Contributions are welcome, espacially if you feel like writing the story (in
english or in french).

# Installation

The goal is to make it a gem. For now, you can simply clone or download the 
files on your system.

You can then run `ruby training.rb` at the top level of the directory. This file
requires all the files needed to run the game in its current state. If you want
to test some part of the game, simply do it in this file.
